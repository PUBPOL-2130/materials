# James Turk guest lecture, Wed Feb 12

The first part of this makeup class was a mini-lecture on [MAUP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifiable_areal_unit_problem), the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem, with some simple chalkboard examples.

Then [James Turk](https://cs.uchicago.edu/news/civic-tech-pioneer-james-turk-joins-uchicago-cs-to-teach-in-mpcs-capp/) (clinical professor who helps run the [CAPP](https://capp.uchicago.edu/curriculum/) program at UChicago) spoke about web scraping.
